## Introduction
This project explores the 1000 Cameras Dataset on kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/1000-cameras-dataset).  Project files can be found at the [main GitHub repo](https://github.com/preetiamin/cameras).

## Project Motivation
The purpose of this project to explore cameras released from 1994 to 2007 and determine what has changed over the years and what is special about the higher end cameras.

## Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

## Technologies
* Python, jupyter
* numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy and sklearn libraries

## Questions answered in the analysis

#### Question 1: What has changed over the years for cameras?
Resolution and effective pixels have increased over the years.

#### Question 2: How much do the prices of cameras vary?
Prices of cameras vary quite a bit, but most of them are less than $1000.

#### Question 3: What is special about the high-end cameras?
In general, cameras more than $2000 were released after 2001, have higher resolution, tend not to come with a lens(thus, have zoom & normal range of 0) and tend to be bigger and heavier.

#### Question 4: Can we accurately predict the price of cameras?
NO, because there’s a lot of noise in the data that is still unexplained.

## Conclusion
Some lower end cameras seem to be just as good if not better than the higher end models. In order to generalize this to the overall population of cameras, we’d need more data for expensive cameras. It would also be interesting to see how cameras have changed since 2007.
